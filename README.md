# TypingTest
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to create a Speed Typing Test with a Mortal Kombat theme.

Using CSS and HTML is getting easier. The Typography I was able to grab from online to help get me started with primarily working on Margins, Paddings, and other CSS layout styles. 
The HTML was simple and I have the javascript functionality to look forward to on the next time I have a moment.
