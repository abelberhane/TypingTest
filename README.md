# TypingTest
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to create a Speed Typing Test with elements of a Mortal Kombat theme. 

Using CSS and HTML is getting easier. The Typography I was able to grab from online to help get me started and working on Margins, Paddings, and other CSS layout styles right away. 

The HTML was simple and I have the javascript functionality to look forward to on the next time I have a moment. There are 2 more images and some more style changes I would like to implement to complete the Mortal Kombat theme.
