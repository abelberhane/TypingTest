# TypingTest
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to create a Speed Typing Test with elements of a Mortal Kombat theme. 

Using CSS and HTML is getting easier. The Typography I was able to grab from online to help get me started and working on Margins, Paddings, and other CSS layout styles right away. 

The HTML was simple and while the JavaScript was complicated, I utilized a tutorial on Lynda.com to help make sense of the areas that were new. 

Once you begin typing, the counter begins immediately. As long as you are typing correctly the border will stay blue, once you make a mistake, you see the border change to orange. Finally when you are done, it turns green. This was a new way for me to see events occuring and it changing CSS. I enjoyed this project and really like web development so far.


Future Updates:
There are 2 more images and some more style changes I would like to implement to complete the Mortal Kombat theme.
